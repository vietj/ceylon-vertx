"Represents a client-side HTTP request.
 
 Instances are created by an [[HttpClient]] instance, via one of the methods corresponding to the
 specific HTTP methods, or the generic `request` method. Once a request has been obtained, headers can be set on
 it, and data can be written to its body if required. Once you are ready to send the request, the `end()` method
 should be called.
 
 Nothing is actually sent until the request has been internally assigned an HTTP connection. The [[HttpClient]]
 instance will return an instance of this class immediately, even if there are no HTTP connections available
 in the pool. Any requests sent before a connection is assigned will be queued internally and actually sent
 when an HTTP connection becomes available from the pool.
 
 The headers of the request are actually sent either when the `end()` method is called, or, when the first
 part of the body is written, whichever occurs first.
 
 This class supports both chunked and non-chunked HTTP.
 
 An example of using this class is as follows:
 
     HttpClientRequest req = client.
         request(\"POST\", \"/some-url\").
         header(\"some-header\", \"hello\").
         header(\"Content-Length\", \"5\").
         end(\"hello\");
     req.promise.then_((HttpClientResponse resp) => print(\"Got response \`resp.status\`\");
 
 Instances of HttpClientRequest are not thread-safe."
