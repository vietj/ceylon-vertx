"An HTTP client that maintains a pool of connections to a specific host, at a specific port. The client supports
 pipelining of requests.
 
 If an instance is instantiated from an event loop then the handlers of the instance will always be called on that
 same event loop. If an instance is instantiated from some other arbitrary Java thread (i.e. when running embedded)
 then and event loop will be assigned to the instance and used when any of its handlers are called.
 
 Instances of HttpClient are thread-safe."
