"Represents a server-side HTTP response. Instances of this class are created and associated to every instance of
 [[HttpServerRequest]] that is created. It allows the developer to control the HTTP response that is sent back to the
 client for a particular HTTP request. It contains methods that allow HTTP  headers and trailers to be set, and
 for a body to be written out to the response.
 
 Instances of this class are not thread-safe."
