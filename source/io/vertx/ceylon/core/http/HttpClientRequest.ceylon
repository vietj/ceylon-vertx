"""Represents a client-side HTTP request.
 
   Instances are created by an [[HttpClient]] instance, via one of the methods corresponding to the
   specific HTTP methods, or the generic `request` method. Once a request has been obtained, headers can be set on
   it, and data can be written to its body if required. Once you are ready to send the request, the `end()` method
   should be called.
 
   Nothing is actually sent until the request has been internally assigned an HTTP connection. The [[HttpClient]]
   instance will return an instance of this class immediately, even if there are no HTTP connections available
   in the pool. Any requests sent before a connection is assigned will be queued internally and actually sent
   when an HTTP connection becomes available from the pool.
 
   The headers of the request are actually sent either when the `end()` method is called, or, when the first
   part of the body is written, whichever occurs first.
 
   This class supports both chunked and non-chunked HTTP.
 
   An example of using this class is as follows:
 
   ~~~
   HttpClientRequest req = client.
     request(post, "/some-url").
     headers { "some-header"->"hello", "Content-Length"->"5" };
   req.response.onComplete((HttpClientResponse resp) => print("Got response ``resp.status``"));
   req.end("hello");
   ~~~
 
   Instances of HttpClientRequest are not thread-safe."""
